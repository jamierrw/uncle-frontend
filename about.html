      <h2>A space to say what's on your mind.</h2>
      <p class="intro">Uncle Steady is here to listen and to help. Whether there's something you're unsure about, embarrassed to share, or too complicated to say out loud &ndash; you're safe here. No judgment, no noise.</p>
      <h2>When the chat ends, it's gone.</h2>
      <p class="intro">Nothing you say is stored. There's no account, no personal data or tracking, no conversation history. It's just you and uncle.</p>
      <h2>Not your typical AI.</h2>
      <p class="intro">Uncle Steady may sometimes sound funny, but his words come from deeper places &ndash; rather than general internet 'wisdom', his responses are shaped by the literature of great writers &ndash; people of the highest emotional intelligence.</p>
